edit update big update rolled december th lots big changes really improved device first n key originally functioned home key taking back original home screen functions menu key instead like new nook tablet prior softkey arrow would bring menu function barnes noble moved function strictly hardware i'm torn whether like update honestly don't like relying just hardware key something like menu especially issues i've nook parts i've owned two cords past year alone makes multi taking easier switching one application another say reading internet don't go home menu function first us nook color originals takes adjusting old habits far it's not bad change reader application functions much friendly manner page numbers bottom pages instead top much less chintzy font pulling menu tell many pages left chapter not really necessary change kind nice fonts added along finally adding option change tone page white sepia night white books also read sideways two page fashion though i'll admit don't use much won't even ability something kids books just makes actual reader app much rounded friendly one magazine reader changes nice animations page turns though don't option books big congruency though animations disappear zoom menu bottom pulls pages miniature picture form much appealing accessible manner rather mac esque really nothing huge makes friendly looking randomly magazine reading app only one n button still home button not menu one wondering they'll notice change future pdf reader awesome changes reading pdf files incredibly clunky not resolve well screen reading book involved zooming scrolling instead sideways like ereader application closed pdf file reopening would take right back page one never saved last place ridiculously cumbersome not user friendly new update not only saves place resolves page text fits better screen allows pages read much easily sideways also scrolls sideways instead just makes sense follows overall expectations reading experience interestingly enough still haven't resolved issue pdf files not cover home screen menu even information attached something hoping they'd resolve it's not huge issue it's just visual annoyance epub files cool graphics show home screen pdf files just grey title book lame overall performance menu functions flipping tasks seems zippier really appreciate menu functions seem much efficient smooth just makes much better interaction ebook store also changed around b n completely reordered categories changed look can't say appreciate changes made no longer organize things like apps books based price instead search manually menu i'm frugal i'll admit miss ability find free apps easily let's face just makes happy overall love update rolled though it's nice know b n staying loyal original customers keeping devices updated edit barnes noble update recently fixed glitches screen plugged finally not issues screen lagging glitching since edit new update allows android apps email nook exciting i'm not apps especially games it's nice touch also fixed issue not able put books home screen issue nook recognizing cover art books also put apps home screen email pandora app gives entire thing much freer customizable feel though apparently update cancelled last one screen glitches plugged back oh well i'm just happy able put books home screen vast improvement right original review received nook color gift early christmas using weeks enough time decided make educated review pros cons great screen sharp resolution book title colors wallpapers look sharp clear touchscreen responsive adjust brightness though rarely found need adjust brightness even quarter could since otherwise bit bright eyes said found plug power source try use touchscreen goes crazy won't even perform simple tasks like unlocking device can't flip next screen without several swipes turning pages haphazard activity weird glitch doesn't affect device isn't connected power source it's pain device low battery power want read it's charging hardware nook color nice muted metallic finish front back gives nice grip though immediately bought cover fact it's somewhat grippy doesn't matter much longer weight nice weight small hardcover book found rather pleasant holding still don't get random open hole thing lower left hand corner though it's like you're supposed use clip device onto something hardly thing someone going just clip onto keychain convenience it's clearly not awful looking guess just seems kind superfluous oh well battery life surprisingly good don't wifi i'm home device go several days low brightness actually one charge days one time pretty impressed considering devices lcd features tend eat battery life like kids eat cocoa puffs it's android based great however b n doesn't allow apps android market crime considering tablet could fantastic tool b n would open gates one fact it's android based isn't really selling point it's potential point keep eye one hopefully company road tablet come certain apps like pandora games like sudoku pinch you're bored comes wifi enabled connects networks easily without issues recognize b n wifi hot spots remembers means don't reprogram networks worry not able access store features really convenient browser pretty decent doesn't flash performs very well actually used emails checking facebook town snappy quick though fact doesn't pinch pull zooming features picture gallery oddly enough bit turn make browsing somewhat clunky inaccurate b n store device convenient loads content easily very user friendly navigate information downloads quick easy also set password downloads prevent someone downloading books without approval also gift card b n use buy books go online account first save information account it'll charge it'll always charge card first credit card pretty cool feature reader awesome sideload epub files easily onto device computer start reading immediately can't however read pub files like regular nook found obnoxious since lot ebooks format b n affiliated website no less also can't put files haven't downloaded directly b n store device over wifi onto home screen order pull personal files sideloaded onto device even ones downloaded directly b n online go bookshelf menu go means don't wifi time very books able put home screen childish thing b n really takes away personalization tablet could well bothered heck first discovered granted could probably fix rooting device run risk issues software hopefully b n come update fix annoyance nook read pdf files it's very awkward process since screen ratio doesn't fit allotted size making text tiny incomprehensible trying reads books format headache zooming awkward clunky takes long worth effort also closing reopening file takes back first page you're attempting read extensive document several sittings gets really old really fast book pdf form would suggest downloading something like calibre converting epub save trouble music loads plays easily though honestly haven't used feature much since ipod want playlist go pictures also load easily though gallery grid feature see previews otherwise just displayed file type images click open silly little issue something b n hopefully fix future anyway great product really potential actual greatness point love fact don't leave house read book great since i'm home infant time worth money buy directly b n online it's isn't awful price touchscreen reader it's really only regular nook kindle would say yes it's just still somewhat disappointing feels like it's half finished i'm looking forward see goes

got nook since b n didn't good price exactly needed also seems better made product one came color nook
bought replace broken micro usb cable old charger nook tablet wished could just get cable ac plug works fine weeks micro usb end cable broke rd barnes noble cable gone not purchasing another plain micro usb cable charge nook tablet save money get cheaper unbranded cable instead
original adapter came nook color years without problems years finally broke didn't even know people troubles chargers buy new one one least couple weeks don't seem problems original charger finally break area plugs system though everyone problems not deny seems issue loses star personally haven't major problems still give stars
original chargers nooks dying literally falling apart couple years hopefully replacement chargers last just long not longer
third adapter tried buying direct b n adapter quality made works excellent device better made original great value
works described owned years works well no complaints great product excellent price
since it's cable digital data shielding isn't big issue hdmi use satellite boxes hd plus audio no problems
only weeks not noticed one problem price compared hdmi cables feel like big item
it's not top line means certainly good value price
bought cable hook apple tv save money expensive cable buy one works great
item exactly says good price complaint not purchase longer one need course fault versus product length works need hdmi cable fill job very well
wire heavy grade cables can't really tell strong connectors till break
item described post simple just needed great price actually bought two good value
amazon prime things only arrived quickly just time hookup computer entertainment systems new tv they're fantastic
cable works advertised no need spend hdmi cable no difference picture quality cable brands costing much much
inexpensive get job done i'm glad got use wdtv work love 'em lose i'll just buy another set
gold good makes best quality connections data trans length adequate ft length attenuate diminish quality signals also sheathing reduce illuminate cross talk interference cable used connect bluray player wi fi inch plasma tv w hitch amazon cables just good think come china thickness wire gold plate factors quality data links like size hose water much pressure endure free shipping can't go wrong guaranteed took three weeks delivery
don't much exciting say cable i'm not videophile means cable works don't see problems bunch cheaper could get best buy
cable cable it's going work time no matter buy amazon always best prices
cable works fantastic didnt pay highly recommend glad gave cheap price hdmi shot
price right cannot discern difference cable higher priced cable possession maybe i'll see difference upgrade k products
bought replace foot cable bought target would cause picture glitches dropouts regularly one works flawlessly twice long fraction price
purchased years ago forgot write review needless say i'm still using no problems purchased back cheapest hdmi cord great buy recommend
much cheaper buying local store one fourth price actually using realize longer one would make tasks need much easier

film definitely not anyone especially fond independent delightfully manipulative clever boy brain child samuel clemens's classic one example book great fun scenes involving aunt polly simple minded soul thinks quite clever genuinely shrewd tom plays catering polly's illusions wit far cry beautiful intelligent celeste holm's portrayal polly family's poverty clearly seen book disappears sawyers occupy beautiful home close friends wealthy widow douglas plot distorted ways remove charm original tom's taking quot play pirates quot becky jilts changed troubled kid's escape aunt polly tells quot no good quot father humour engaging portrayal adolescent quot first love quot gone theme tom's learning responsibility overworked sequences hilarious book sunday school classroom etc largely left enchanting becky thatcher reduced tomboy isn't much picnic sequence ruined gathering kids changed song dance outing families tom sawyer quite realistic setting forth kids far concerned fretting parents let's not turn commentary quot family values quot la political correctness johnny whitaker's singing voice appeal chalk squeaking blackboard rendition quot god quot aside text nothing story tom's only church interests time play pinch bug pure purgatory listener
hadn't heard movie version classic mark twain story recently absolutely see music sherman brothers best known work mary poppins love good musical book stays very true novel tom sawyer johnny whitaker young boy growing 's hannibal missouri orphan he's raised aunt polly celeste holm quite handful regularly plays hooky fish swim best pal huckleberry finn jeff east constantly lies get trouble movie watch tom struggles conscience witnessing murder cemetery tricks boys town white washing fence develops crush new girl becky thatcher young jodie foster injun joe kunu hank get sworn revenge boy movie extremely faithful book hitting highlights classic frankly problem since took little get going got story hooked really began enjoy tale scenery costumes recreate times well acting pretty good unfortunately found songs disappointing weren't bad weren't good either aren't especially memorable singable don't really advance story would rather rewatch movie characters adventures songs despite rather major flaw musical must admit enjoying sweetness innocence enjoyed songs easy overlook since aren't major part movie looking fun version classic tale much worse one
advertisment dvd amazon incorrect ad stated dvd wide screen anamorphic format dvd not format standard pan scan poor quality transfer film thought returning decided give gift motion pictures filmed anamorphic format only transfered dvd format people make decision use pan scan fill standard television ill advised poorly educated artistic principles
would love buy movie hannibal missouri mark twain atractions buy movie would real treat it's pan scan forget dont buy full screen movies unless it's made tv think mgm included widescreen version movie joke
movie playing radio city music hall back days movie stage show formt also presented mm huge radio city screen remember impressed opening scene steam boat going river see tom running thru field music builds wow great movie i've seen many versions quot tom sawyer quot one seems best ever brought screen maybe it's musical whatever made successful back not disappointed it's gradure scope must ever american kid adult red white blue gets must politically incorrect movie ever made hehe buy group puts ban want buy kids even don't make like anymore
well made well acted musical version tom sawyer story not follow book exactly substance charming performances child actors johnny whitaker tom jodie foster becky thatcher academy award winner celeste holm aunt polly thoroughly enjoyed movie rented granddaughter's school project wound watching times took back childhood playing children next door neighborly world highly recommended
